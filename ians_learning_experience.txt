Ian Fell - Learning Experience:
I learned that Parsers are just basically finite state machines and that we have lots of builders and stuff. The builders then call the visitor methods and generates the code. We finished at about 9:00 pm the night before its due and we will probably stay up another hour trying to print it. I also learned that the Design of a software system is a collection of UML diagrams and specifications. Jack Reeves was wrong and the source code is not the design. Our job was to design and not implement and that is what we did to the best of our ability. I hope you find our gobbled mess enjoyable to read. However, please do not try to implement your SDCG as you might find that the design changes as you begin to implement it. After all, software developers are not engineers, but are a pack of monkeys designing software systems that will lead to utter failure and millions of dollars lost to those companies. If I had to do it over again, I would have come up with a simple/minimilistic design and then begin the development stage using all of the extreme programming software development techniques.
