* Shape is no longer a decal type, with implementors for each shape.
Instead, we have one ShapeDecal, concrete, and then a Shape type, with an implementor for each type.
The ShapeDecal holds some Shape, and upon render being called, will make a RenderVisiter, and have it be accepted by the shape.
The ShapeDecal holds color, and paramtizes the visiter with the info it needs to render any shape.
The Visiter then knows the details to ask each shape for how to render it, such as radius for a circle, and can then do that rendering.
When this is done, the ShapeDecal will ask the visiter for said rendered image, and return that image.
