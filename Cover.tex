The work I have done here is my own, and I have neither broken nor bent the honor code.

\item Matthew Bregg : This project was something different from anything I've done far. Not actually implementing changed things, as we had to be very careful to think about would something work, as there was no implementation to test if our idea was viable. However, it did mean that some sections what would be awkward, or annoying to right, but known to be possible, we didn't have to worry about, and design is overall faster than code. The hardest part I found was for all of us to properly communicate our ideas, and to choose upon one idea. We spent too long, a good week or so, circling around what to do in the very beginning, and didn't make any real progress until we finally just picked one of the ideas we had in the first day or so, and decided to start expanding on it. The easiest part, I think, was writing the Final Document, once the uml and basic design was done.
