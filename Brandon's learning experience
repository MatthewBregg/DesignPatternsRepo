During this project, I learned more practical and hands on knowledge about using different design patterns. Not only that but I gained more experience in working in group programming projects. I think the hardest part of the project was trying to all agree and decide on a direction and goal together, since everyone had their own ideas about how to accomplish this. Once we got the ball rolling though, things went relatively smoothly, and overall it wasn't largely impossible since we stayed on top of everything as a team. I think we accomplished what the project was suppose to teach us, and learned alot about practical design pattern use outside  theoretical or sample codes.
